# What is EasyLogs?

EasyLogs is a agnostic dashboard for display and filter logs. It can be used with any log source.

The main idea is to provide a simple and lightweight dashboard to visualize logs that you can use quickly.

## Why not...

There are a lot of log dashboards out there:

- Kibana
- Graylog
- Splunk
- Logstash
- ...

But most of them are very complex to configure and use. EasyLogs is a simple dashboard that can be used with any log source.

## EasyLogs is for you if...

- You want to use a simple dashboard.
- You want to visualize logs in a simple way.
- You want only a basic logs filtering.
- You want a fast deployment and lightweight dashboard.
- You don't need a complex log dashboard.
- You don't want to spend time configuring a log dashboard.
- You don't need analytics of your logs.

# Deployment

EasyLogs is composed by:

- The Web Application, aka, the Dashboard.
- MongoDB database for storing logs.
- Redis database for storing sessions.

So, you need to have both running.

## Configuration

EasyLogs is configured using environment variables. This table shows all the available configuration options:

| Variable | Description                | Default value |
| --- |----------------------------| -- |
| `REDIS_URI` | Redis Connection string | `redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0` |
| `MONGO_DB` | MongoDB database | `easylogs` |
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB Connection string | `mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27099` |
| `ADMIN_USER` | Admin user | `admin` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin Password | `adminadmin` |
| `RECEIVE_LOGS_KEY` | Key used to authenticate loggers  | `LIh982y87GgljahsadfklJHLIUG87g1u1e7f6eb2ee145571858e8e24` |
| `EMBEDED_DB` | If this variable is set, enables MongoDB and Redis embedded databases. Allowed values: TRUE|TRUE | Not set |

> NOTE: If you want to use MongoDB embedded database, you don't need to set `MONGO_URI` and `MONGO_DB` variables.

> Currently, EasyLogs only support fixed authentication. In the future, we will add support for other authentication methods.

## Docker (standalone)

Easylog has the possibility to run MongoDB and the Web Application in the same container. This is the easiest way to run EasyLogs.

```bash
> docker run -e EMBEDED_DB=1 -p 8080:8080 cr0hn/easylogs
```

> NOTE: Not recommended for production environments.

## Docker (external MongoDB & Redis)

If you want to run EasyLogs in a production environment, you should use an external MongoDB & Redis databases.

```bash
> export MONGO_URI=mongodb://...
> export REDIS_URI=redis://...
> docker run -e MONGODB_URI=$MONGODB_URI -e REDIS_URI=$REDIS_URI -p 8080:8080 cr0hn/easylogs
```

> NOTE: If you don't want to deploy and maintain a MongoDB, you can use a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) cloud database. It's free, simple and fast.
> NOTE: If you don't want to deploy and maintain a Redis, you can use a [Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com/) cloud database. It's free, simple and fast.

## Docker Compose

You can use the provided ``docker-compose.yaml`` file to run EasyLogs with an external MongoDB database.

```bash
> export MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
> export MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=example
> docker-compose -p easy-logs up -d
```

> NOTE: If you want to expose MongoDB & Redis ports, be sure you add the ``ports:`` section in the ``docker-compose.yaml`` file.

# Connecting to EasyLogs

Once you have EasyLogs running, you can connect to it using the default credentials (Unless you have changed them):

- User: ``admin``
- Password: ``adminadmin``

Then you can connect to the dashboard using the URL: ``http://localhost:8080``

# How to log to EasyLogs?

EasyLogs can be used with any log source.

## Python

### Python HTTP Handler (default implementation)

Python has a builtin [HTTP Handler log](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.HTTPHandler) that can be used to send logs to EasyLogs:

```python
"""
This file configures a logger and sent the log to a remote HTTP server.
"""

import logging
import logging.handlers

def get_log(name: str): 
  # Get new logger
  logging.basicConfig()

  logger = logging.getLogger(name)
  
  # Configure logger to send logs to EasyLogs
  easy_logs_host = "http://localhost:8080"
  easy_logs_path = "/loggers/python/http-handler"
  easy_logs_token = "LIh982y87GgljahsadfklJHLIUG87g1u1e7f6eb2ee145571858e8e24"
  
  # Create HTTP handler
  http_handler = logging.handlers.HTTPHandler(
      easy_logs_host,
      f'{easy_logs_path}?key={easy_logs_token}',
      method='POST',
  )
  logger.addHandler(http_handler)
  
  return logger
  

logger = get_log("easylogs")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Send logs
logger.info('This is a test log message')

try:
    1 / 0
except Exception as e:
    logger.error('Error', exc_info=e, extra={'foo': 'bar'}, stack_info=True)
    logger.exception("asdf", e)
```

> WARNING: The default handler doesn't manager connections errors. Bot a better resilient HTTP handler see next point.

### Python HTTP Handler (fault-tolerant version)

This is a fault-tolerant HTTP handler for send logs. If server doesn't responds, keep the logs and try again later.

```python
import queue
import logging
import logging.handlers

#
# This is the HTTP Handler for a resilient log client
#
class HTTPHandlerResilient(logging.handlers.HTTPHandler):
    def __init__(self, host, url, method='GET', secure=True):
        super().__init__(host, url, method, secure)
        self._queue = queue.Queue()

    def emit(self, record):
        try:
            super().emit(record)

            # If not error, try to send any remaining messages
            while True:
                try:
                    super().emit(self._queue.get_nowait())
                except queue.Empty:
                    break

        except ConnectionError:
            self._queue.put(record)

    def handleError(self, record):
        raise ConnectionError()


def get_log(name: str): 
  # Get new logger
  logging.basicConfig()

  logger = logging.getLogger(name)
  
  # Configure logger to send logs to EasyLogs
  easy_logs_host = "http://localhost:8080"
  easy_logs_path = "/loggers/python/http-handler"
  easy_logs_token = "LIh982y87GgljahsadfklJHLIUG87g1u1e7f6eb2ee145571858e8e24"
  
  #
  # CHANGE THIS: logging.handlers.HTTPHandler -> HTTPHandlerResilient
  #    
  http_handler = HTTPHandlerResilient(
      easy_logs_host,
      f'{easy_logs_path}?key={easy_logs_token}',
      method='POST',
  )
  logger.addHandler(http_handler)
  
  return logger
```

# Contributing

You can contribute to this project in many ways:

- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting new features
- Writing or editing documentation
- **Adding new loggers** (Python, Go, NodeJS, C#, Ruby, ...)

## Adding new loggers

Thanks for your interest in contributing to EasyLogs!

If you want to add a new logger, please, follow this steps:

1. Create a new folder under ``examples`` folder with the name of the language.
2. Create a new file with the name of the logger (e.g: ``http-handler.go``)
3. Create a README.md file with the instructions to use the logger.

Have in count that I'll need to reproduce the example to test it and add a new end-point to the API. So I'll need to execute the example.

## Adding new loggers + API

If you are here, thanks! You are awesome!

If you also know Python and want to add a new end-point to the API, please, follow this steps:

1. Copy & paste the ``easy_logs/loggers/python`` package and rename it to the name of the language.
2. Adapt the code to the new language following the same structure.

# TODO

- [ ] Improve pagination for long logs
- [ ] Add generic endpoint to push logs.
- [ ] Add more text
- [ ] Add more languages
- [ ] Improve authentication system: add API key support, multi-user...
- [ ] Add download logs button
- [ ] Add filter by date
